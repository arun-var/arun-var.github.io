Full stack developer turned Automation/DevOps Engineer, I have hands-on experience in supporting, automating, monitoring and optimizing mission critical deployments and infrastructure - leveraging configuration management, CI/CD, and DevOps processes.
I now find love in troubleshooting/debugging issues, finding performance bottlenecks and improving build release time. Self Motivated, self-starter and a technology enthusiast. I gorge on blogs/articles on technology and football.
